# MACHINE-LEARNING
This repository contains machine learning experiments and notes for various projects. It includes algorithms, datasets, results, and observations for quick reference and learning. The experiments range from beginner-level implementations to advanced machine learning techniques like:

- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs)
- Feature Engineering and Model Tuning
The goal is to build a robust collection of experiments, results, and insights for ongoing learning and reference.
# Dependencies
The main libraries and tools used include:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch (for deep learning experiments)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive notes)
